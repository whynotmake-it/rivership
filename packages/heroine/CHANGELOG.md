## 0.5.0-dev.3

> Note: This release has breaking changes.

 - **DOCS**: improved zoom transition examples.
 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**: Heroine now accepts any `Motion`, not just springs.
 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**: Add `HeroineMode`, an equivalent to `HeroMode` for Heroine.

    Heroine does not respect `HeroMode` anymore, use `HeroineMode` instead.
    This allows for better parallel use of Heroine and Hero in the same tree.


## 0.5.0-dev.2

 - **FEAT**: support nested heroines if they are not part of the same transition.
 - **FEAT**: update examples to use new motor motion APIs.

 - **FEAT**: support separate motion per dimension.

## 0.5.0-dev.0

> Note: This release has breaking changes.

 - **FEAT**: use new `Motion` based APIs from motor internally.

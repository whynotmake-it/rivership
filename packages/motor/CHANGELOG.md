## 1.0.0-dev.8

> Note: This release has breaking changes.

 - **FIX**: all motion controllers now correctly report their status, even for imprecise simulations.
 - **BREAKING** **REFACTOR**: `Motion.none` will not jump to target anymore, but hold at current value instead.
 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**: all spring motions now default to `snapToEnd: false` to reduce unexpected jitter when animating.

## 1.0.0-dev.7

> Note: This release has breaking changes.

 - **BREAKING** **FIX**: `SequenceMotionController` will not skip the initial phase (#164).

    However, all sequences with a single provided motion will now return `NoMotion` for the very initial phase only. This retains the expected playing behavior, while working better with customized motions per phase.


## 1.0.0-dev.6

> Note: This release has breaking changes.

 - **FEAT**: add constants for included MotionConverters.
 - **FEAT**: add sequence animations to motor.
 - **FEAT**: add TrimmedMotion as a way to take subsets of any motion.
 - **DOCS**: add phase animation to readme.
 - **DOCS**: way better examples.
 - **BREAKING** **REFACTOR**: use `MotionConverter.custom()` if you want to pass custom normalization callbacks.
 - **BREAKING** **REFACTOR**: use const constructors for material springs and make default constructor private.
 - **BREAKING** **REFACTOR**: use positional parameters for `CurvedMotion`.
 - **BREAKING** **BUILD**: require Flutter 3.32.

## 1.0.0-dev.5
 - Nothing relevant

## 1.0.0-dev.4

 - **FIX**: use the correct parameters for `MaterialSpringMotion` (#127).

## 1.0.0-dev.3

 - **DOCS**: add title gif to README.
 - **DOCS**: add title slide to example.

## 1.0.0-dev.2

> Note: This release has breaking changes.

 - **FEAT**: add Material 3 Expressive spring tokens.
 - **BREAKING** **REFACTOR**: turned `CupertinoMotion` constants into constructors so parameters can be adjusted on the fly.
